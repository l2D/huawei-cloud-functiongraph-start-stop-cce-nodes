# CCE Nodes Start/Stop Function
[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fl2D%2Fhuawei-cloud-functiongraph-start-stop-cce-nodes.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Fl2D%2Fhuawei-cloud-functiongraph-start-stop-cce-nodes?ref=badge_shield)


This serverless function is designed to start or stop Elastic Cloud Server (ECS) instances on Huawei Cloud. It's intended to be deployed on FunctionGraph.

## Features

- List ECS servers in a specified cluster
- Start ECS servers
- Stop ECS servers (with option for soft or hard stop)

## Prerequisites

- Huawei Cloud account
- Access Key (AK) and Secret Key (SK) with appropriate permissions
- Python 3.9 or later

## Dependencies

- `huaweicloudsdkcore`
- `huaweicloudsdkecs`

## Configuration

The function uses the following configuration parameters, which should be set as environment variables or function configurations in FunctionGraph:

- `projectId`: Your Huawei Cloud project ID
- `endpoint`: (Optional) The endpoint URL for the ECS service
- `region`: The region where your ECS instances are located
- `ak`: Access Key (can be overridden by FunctionGraph's built-in key)
- `sk`: Secret Key (can be overridden by FunctionGraph's built-in key)
- `type`: The stop type, either "SOFT" or "HARD" (default is "SOFT")
- `action`: The action to perform, either "start" or "stop"
- `clusterId`: (Optional) The ID of the CCE cluster to filter ECS instances

## Usage

The function can be triggered via FunctionGraph. The action (start or stop) and other parameters are determined by the function's configuration.

### Example Event

The function doesn't require any specific event structure. All necessary information is retrieved from the function's configuration.

```json
{}
```

## Function Behavior

1. The function first validates the configuration parameters.
2. It then establishes a connection to the ECS service using the provided credentials.
3. Depending on the specified action:
   - For "stop": It lists all servers in the specified cluster (or all if no cluster is specified) and then stops them.
   - For "start": It lists all servers in the specified cluster (or all if no cluster is specified) and then starts them.
4. The function returns a JSON object with the status of the operation, including any errors encountered.

## Return Value

The function returns a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "status": "success" or "error",
  "message": "Description of the result or error",
  "action": "start" or "stop",
  "data": {
    "server_list": [
      {"server_id": "id1", "server_name": "name1"},
      {"server_id": "id2", "server_name": "name2"},
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

In case of an error, the `data` field may contain additional error information.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that the AK/SK used have the minimum necessary permissions to perform the required actions on ECS instances.
- Be cautious when stopping instances, especially with the "HARD" stop type, as it may lead to data loss if instances are not properly shut down.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter authentication errors, verify that your AK/SK are correct and have the necessary permissions.
- For region-specific issues, ensure that the specified region matches the location of your ECS instances.
- Check the FunctionGraph logs for detailed error messages in case of failures.
